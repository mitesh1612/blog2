Hey there. So I planned to do this, at least not 15 days later into the year. 2020 has been a mess of an year and eventhough, on the surface, the start might not be awesome, I have better hopes and goals for 2021. One of these goals is to write even more in this blog (considering I've written, what like 6 posts in 5 months?). We will see how that pans out in the future, but here is one update that I'd like to share, and the topic you might see future posts on.

So I wanted to write an Android App, for a personal usecase. It's not that esoteric and an app already exists for it. Then why write one? Because the app required a purchase to keep working and I had a feeling I can create the same app, without the need of any purchase or ads. Now I don't really plan to distribute this app on Google Play Store, so other than my "man-hours" and time spent in creating it, I wouldn't be having any kind of monetary investment in this. Since its a personal usecase and the app will be written by me only, I am okay with installing it on my phone. So then came the first hurdle in this journey, how to start and which tech stack to use?

## The Options

Now I know, the title kindo spoils my end choice, but I'll still like to share why I choose Xamarin. Since I know nothing about app development and not really good at UI development as well, I wanted an easy entry point for my first ever Android App. (Yes, I've gotten around doing my Bachelors and Masters without writing a single Android app ðŸ˜‹). I knew a fair amount of JavaScript and TypeScript, but I am not good at UI development, so I skipped React-Native, eventhough it being one of my primary choices (since the library code I wanted to write could be written in JS/TS easily) and I didnt wanna learn, yet another JS framework, so skipped Ionic and Cordova as well. I didn't want to learn yet another language as well, since currently my focus has been on how to write good and maintainable code in the languages I know, so eventhough being similar to JavaScript, I skipped Dart & Flutter. I skipped Kotlin, and all the other native Android stuff Google provides, alongwith Android Studio, primarily because Android Studio is very resource intensive and might just kill my laptop. Plus again, I didn't wanna learn another language (Kotlin).

If you've been following the blog, you might have noticed that I have been working in C# from some time. I remembered Microsoft creating `Xamarin` for cross platform app development. Hence I chose Xamarin. I already have Visual Studio on my laptop, I need to practice writing better C# code anyways. Plus I wanted to do all the processing required for this app on-device and not rely on some web service (since they can add/create costs), I thought it would be a good experience in writing that code in C# and learn how to do "more" using C#. Hence I chose Xamarin as my tool (or framework?) of choice.

I'll definitely keep you, my readers updated with my experience and pitfalls of using Xamarin and C#, and my progress with this app I'm trying to write.

Do comment if you have any opinions about my choice or share your experience with Xamarin, if you have any. Until next time. ðŸ˜€
