## Welcome to this blog

Hey everyone, welcome to my blog. I finally took the leap and set up my blog, and after a lot of thinking, I finally decided to create a blog.

Why a blog? Well among a lot of other reasons, like not forgetting what I learn from time to time, and to keep track of my journey as a Software Development Engineer. The other huge reason is that I love to learn new things, research the ones I find interesting, and I plan to document and share my learnings via blog posts, which can be easily found and referred to later as well. I'll try to share things I learn about Software Development, my interests in Data Science and all the other random things I encounter. Hopefully, other people will also find these posts helpful, relevant or interesting. You can always share your views on my GitHub repo [here](http://github.com/mitesh1612/blog-old) (until I figure out adding comment sections to a static GitHub site ðŸ˜‰)

Thanks for visiting this blog!

## About Me

I'm Mitesh Shah, and I live in Hyderabad. I started my journey as a Software Engineer at Microsoft (where I currently work). I have a lot of interest in Data Science and Machine Learning and I love reading books or playing some games in my relaxing time.

## Technical Details for this Blog

This blog is possible due to [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) with the wonderful theme [Novela](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela) created by the Narative Team. Right now this site is hosted on GitHub pages using a CI from GitHub Actions

## Update : 24-12-2020
