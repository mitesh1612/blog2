Hey there. I am the writer and maintainer of this blog, Mitesh Shah. Right now I work as a Software Engineer in Microsoft and love to read up on various topics like Data Science, Machine Learning, Backend Development in my free time.

I have been professionally writing code since 2019 (until then it was mostly academic) and while on my job, I get to learn a lot of things, things that I feel like sharing, or at least storing them for my own references later.

## Tech you can talk to me about:

* Backend Development using **Flask**, **Node + Express**, **ASP.NET**
* Making Databases using **MongoDB**, **MySQL**
* Frontend Development using **Bootstrap**, **React (with Flux/Redux)**
* Creating cloud applications using **Azure**
* Programming languages like **C++**, **C#**, **Python**, **JavaScript / TypeScript**
* **Machine Learning** and the Maths behind it

I like Machine Learning, and love understanding the why behind everything. To facilitate that, I often try to implement the common Machine Learning algorithms from scratch.

Feel free to connect with me on my socials:
