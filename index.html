Hello there, welcome to my blog. I am a Software Engineer and passionate about Machine Learning.

I consider this blog as an oppurtunity to share my learnings with the world (and try to remember them in the process).

Try reading few of my posts, or find posts belonging to a certain category using the tags. To learn more about me, visit the **About** page up top.
