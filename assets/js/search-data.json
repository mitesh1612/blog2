            "title": "Conditional Probability and Families",
            "content": "So I was reading the book ‚ÄúData Science from Scratch‚Äù by Joel Grus. I came across this nice tricky problem in Conditional Probability mentioned in this book. Let‚Äôs take a look . A Quick Refresher on Conditional Probability . Well if you forgot the definition of conditional probability, here is a small refresher for you. Say there are two events E and F. The probability that E happens given that we know F happens is represented using P(E | F). | . Mathematically, P(E | F) = P(E,F)/P(F). P(E,F) is the probability of both E and F happening. | . Well enough of a probability class, lets look at an interesting family now . The Family and The Unknown Children . Say there is a family with two unknown children. If we assume that: . Each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl | The gender of the second child is independent of the first child. | . Then the event ‚Äúno girls‚Äù has probability 1/4, the event ‚Äúone girl, one boy‚Äù has probability 1/2, and the event ‚Äútwo girls‚Äù has probability 1/4. . Now here comes the interesting problem. ‚ÄúWhat is the probability of the event ‚Äòboth children are girls‚Äô (B) conditional on the event that ‚Äòthe older child is a girl (G)‚Äô?‚Äù . This aint a test, so here is how we can easily calculate this using conditional probability . P(B | G) = P(B,G)/P(G) | . T event B and G (‚Äúboth children are girls and the older child is a girl‚Äù) is just the event B. (Once you know that both children are girls, it‚Äôs necessarily true that the older child is a girl). Thus, . P(B | G) = P(B,G)/P(G) = P(B)/P(G) = 1/2 | . This is mostly intuitive. Now can you guess ‚ÄúWhat is the probability of the event ‚Äòboth children are girls‚Äô (B) conditional on the event that ‚Äòat least one of the children is a girl‚Äô (L)?‚Äù . Surprisingly, the answer to this question is different from the one before. Here is how . As before, the event B and L (‚Äúboth children are girls and at least one of the children is a girl‚Äù) is just the event B. This means we have: . P(B | L) = P(B,L)/P(L) = P(B)/P(L) = 1/3 | . How can this be the case? Well, if all you know is that at least one of the children is a girl, then it is twice as likely that the family has one boy and one girl than that it has both girls. . Still don‚Äôt believe me? . Well if you are the doubting kind, we can write a simple Python code to simulate this experiment. . import enum, random class Kid(enum.Enum): BOY = 0 GIRL = 1 def random_kid() -&gt; Kid: return random.choice([Kid.BOY, Kid.GIRL]) both_girls = 0 older_girl = 0 either_girl = 0 random.seed(20200814) # Yep, this post&#39;s date for _ in range(10000): younger = random_kid() older = random_kid() if older == Kid.GIRL: older_girl += 1 if older == Kid.GIRL and younger == Kid.GIRL: both_girls += 1 if older == Kid.GIRL or younger == Kid.GIRL: either_girl += 1 print(&quot;P(both | older):&quot;, both_girls / older_girl) # 0.494 ~ 1/2 print(&quot;P(both | either): &quot;, both_girls / either_girl) # 0.322 ~ 1/3 . This indicates how the conditioning of an event affects its probability. . Weirdly, this problem reminds me a lot of the Monty Hall Problem. Hey if you have any explaination on how this can relate to Monty Hall, you can always @ me at my socials (linked in this blog at various locations!üòâ) and I‚Äôll probably try to figure out if there is any relation between these two (after I refresh my Probability Course üòã) .",

            "title": "Constructing a complex dictionary of base and derived class using the same code",
            "content": "Okay, really complex title aside, I‚Äôll try to explain the problem I had and the interesting way I found to solve it. This may not be the best or the most optimized way, but I really liked this solution and would like to share it. . Also, although I do prefer Python, this post is in C#, since that was the language I encountered this problem in. . So here is the problem. Say we have two C# Classes . public class BaseClass { public string SomeProperties { get; set; } } public class DerivedClass : BaseClass { public string SomeOtherProperties { get; set; } } . I wanted to construct a Dictionary of these classes like Dictionary&lt;string, BaseClass&gt; and Dictionary&lt;string, DerivedClass&gt; at two very different places. The construction of each dictionary element was not that trivial due to the inherent complexity of filling the properties for both the classes. Here is an example of how one of the dictionaries was being created: . // For the base class var map = new Dictionary&lt;string, BaseClass&gt;(); foreach(var someProperty in someList) { var baseElement = new BaseClass(someProperty); map[someProperty] = baseElement; } foreach(var dependency in dependencyList) { map[dependency.To] = map[dependency.From] } // For the derived class var map = new Dictionary&lt;string, DerivedClass&gt;(); foreach(var someProperty in someList) { // someOtherProperty comes from somewhere else var derivedElement = new DerivedClass(someProperty, someOtherProperty); map[someProperty] = derivedElement; } foreach(var dependency in dependencyList) { map[dependency.To] = map[dependency.From] } . As you can see, there is a lot of logic repeating since the properties that were created for the base class were also created for the derived class, but when we create the DerivedClass object, new properties were also to be added to those object. Both the objects differ in how they are constructed but the way the map is created is similar. I wanted a way to reuse these for loops instead of writing them for both BaseClass and DerivedClass and other classes that might inherit from BaseClass later. . My basic idea was to use a Template method like this. . public Dictionary&lt;string, &lt;T&gt;&gt; CreateDictionary(parameters) { while(someConditionOnParameters) { if(T is BaseClass) { // Base class object creation code } else if(T is DerivedClass) { // Derived class object creation code } // repeated dictionary creation code } } . The other problem that I encounter here in was the arguments to this method. When we create the BaseClass object, I require fewer properties but when I created DerivedClass object, I require more properties and hence the number and type of arguments couldn‚Äôt be fixed. Of course, I can set/pass them as null and ignore when not needed, but that didn‚Äôt feel like a tidy solution to me. Plus later on, when we derive a new class from BaseClass, again the signature of method changes which might break a few things here and there. . That‚Äôs when I was suggested the interesting solution to this problem, the one I am going to share now. We keep one function that creates this dictionary but rather than passing the parameters to create the objects, we pass a function that creates those objects for us. For example when we want to create the BaseClass dictionary, we can pass a function that creates the base class object and so on. This way this method can be extensible for any classes that derive from future as well. Here is a dummy code to show how that method might look like . public Dictionary&lt;string, BaseClass&gt; CreateDictionary(DataObject requiredData, Func&lt;Data, BaseClass&gt; objectCreator) { var map = new Dictionary&lt;string, BaseClass&gt;(); foreach(Data propertyValues in requiredData.data) { var element = objectCreator(Data); } foreach(var dependency in requiredData.dependencies) { map[dependency.To] = dependency.From; } } . Now when I want to create the base class dictionary, I can call it like: . var map = CreateDictionary(requiredData, x =&gt; { return new BaseClass(x.somePropertyValue); }); . Or if I want the derived class dictionary, like this: . var map = CreateDictionary(requiredData, x =&gt; { return new DerivedClass(x.SomePropertyValue, someOtherPropertyValue); }); . I really loved this solution, its nifty and useful and this didnt come to my mind easily. . Closing Thoughts . I know this is a really specific and weird problem to encounter, and some constraints of why this solution was used over other ways are not clear from the vague names and class designs (and possibly incomplete details) I provided. However, I really found the solution interesting and felt like sharing it. .
